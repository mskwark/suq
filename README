This is suq, the Single-User Queuer, or Simple Un-networked Queuer. 

Suq is a single-machine queuer that allows any number of jobs to be submitted 
to a prioritized run queue that then runs the jobs with a specified number at 
a time. 

The queuer itself is very lightweight, and is a daemon that is spawned by the 
client that stops as soon as all jobs have completed.  Client-server 
communication happens through Unix domain sockets that, by default, are put in 
the home directory. This can be changed with the global option '-b basedir'. 


Example usage:

> suq run mdrun 

Submits the job 'mdrun' to the queue. The job is assumed to use one core or 
thread, and runs in the directory where the submit command was done.


> suq run -n 4 mdrun -nt 4

Submits the job 'mdrun' to the queue, using 4 threads. The '-n 4' specifies 
the fact that this job is going to use 4 tasks to the queuer (the '-nt 4' 
option is an option to the 'mdrun' command telling it to use 4 threads).


> suq ls

Gives a list of current running and waiting jobs.


> suq del 2

Deletes and kills the job with ID 2.


> suq del all

Deletes and kills all jobs. 


> suq info 2

Gives detailed information about the job with ID 2.


> suq ntask 4

Sets the total number of tasks (processes and threads) to be 4. This means 
that the queuer will, for example, let 4 single-thread processes run. 


> suq wait

Wait until all jobs submitted so far finish.
